## DGPagedScrollView

DGPagedScrollView is an easy to implement class that creates a Paged Scroll View that behaves like a UITableViewController.
The only thing you have to do to start using it, is create your own class that extends DGPagedViewController and implement only three Delegate and DataSource Methods.

DGPagedScrollView also handles memory allocation and uses only three UIViews with content. It frees hidden views and stores only the visible UIViews.

improvements, documentation, demo, and more to come…
